## Instructions
In this repository, you'll find three datasets, as well as three notebooks, respectively. Each notebook runs a set workflow that has been finetuned for each dataset.

If running in colab, you'll need to upload the datasets for each notebook before running. Since we are using a free tier, the datasets do not persist after being uploaded.

If cloning the repo and running locally, be sure to modify the path of the datasets so that the notebooks can find their respective .csv files.
